Automate bootstrapping a new Django project in a vagrant box
with minimal impact and requirements on the host.

Builds on ansible roles defined in https://github.com/fdemmer/ansible_roles


Requirements
------------

Vagrant >= 1.8


Quickstart
----------

- Clone the django_bootstrap repository
- Execute `run.sh` and choose a name for the project
- Get coffee... this will take a few minutes...
- Enter your vagrant box with `vagrant ssh`
- Run `./manage.py createsuperuser`
- Check everything is up and running at http://10.10.10.10/admin


What does the run.sh script do?
-------------------------------

- Asks for a service name and sets it in the Vagrantfile.

  This will be used by the provisioning in a number of places. Most
  prominently it will be the name of the Django project and the
  hostname of the Vagrant box.
  Hence the numbers and letters limitation.

- Removes the .git directory and initializes a new repository.

  Going forward with the project you will not want to use the origin
  of django_bootstrap, but your own repository. A new git repository
  is initialized and the Vagrantfile and provisioning directory is
  committed.

- Start up a vagrant box and run provisioning.

  Vagrant runs the provisioning, which includes setting up the Django
  project.

- Self destruct.

  The run.sh script removes itself in the end. From now on simply use
  Vagrant to bring up the box or run provisioning again.

  Feel free to customize the Vagrantfile or site.yml now.
