About
-----

An attempt to automate bootstrapping a new Django project in a vagrant box 
with minimal impact and requirements on the host.

Builds on ansible roles defined in https://github.com/fdemmer/ansible_roles


Requirements
------------

Vagrant >= 1.8


Quickstart
----------

- Clone the repository (and delete .git afterwards) or download a zip release.
- Set a project name as the `service_name` in `extra_vars.yml` or just leave 
  "foo" in there if you just quickly need a django box to try something.
- Run `vagrant up`
- Get coffee
- Enter your vagrant box with `vagrant ssh`
- Run `./manage.py createsuperuser`
- Check everything is up and running at http://10.10.10.10/admin
